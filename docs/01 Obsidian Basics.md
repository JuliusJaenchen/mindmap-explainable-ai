# Obsidian
Obsidian is a cross-platform software for note-taking and knowledge organisation. With a Markdown-based approach, it makes it easy to write and link notes. Particularly noteworthy is the bidirectional linking, which shows relationships between ideas. The graph view visualises these connections. Obsidian follows a "local-first" approach, stores data locally and offers optional cloud synchronisation. The software supports plugin extensions to customise functionality and offers powerful search functions for efficient access to information. Suitable for knowledge workers, researchers and writers looking for a flexible and connected note-taking solution.

# Create files
There are several ways to create a file in Obsidian.

##### Directly in the editor:
- Open Obsidian.
- Start writing in an empty area of the editor, then save the file with a new file name. Obsidian will automatically create the file.

##### Use of [[]] (double brackets):
- Use double brackets to create a new reference to a file that does not yet exist. Click on the link and Obsidian will create a new file with that name.

##### Copy and paste:
- Copy an existing text or section.
- Paste it into an empty area of the editor. If the text contains a non-existent file reference, Obsidian will create a new file.
 
##### Via the sidebar:
- Right-click on a folder in the sidebar.
- Select "Create new file" from the context menu and name the file.

# UI components
More information on [https://help.obsidian.md/Home](https://help.obsidian.md/Home) under *User Interface/Workspace*
## Command bar 
The command bar is visible in the left sidebar on the desktop, even when it is closed. On mobile devices, the command bar is accessible via the menu. Each action is represented by an icon that is activated by clicking or tapping. The top icons are from plugins, the bottom three are system-relevant commands.

The command bar can be customised by dragging the icons or hiding them by right-clicking on the desktop. On mobile devices, customisation is done via the settings.

The quick access option on mobile devices can be configured in the settings. The order and visibility of command bar elements can be changed by long pressing and dragging or using the red and green buttons in the settings.
 
## Sidebar and tabs
Obsidian has two sidebars on the desktop, left and right. The left sidebar contains the command bar (ribbon). On mobile devices, there is only a collapsed left sidebar. To open it, click on the arrow symbol on the left or right.
Tabs: By default, plugins only create individual tabs. You can switch between them and close them by right-clicking. Some cannot be closed, then deactivate the plugin or collapse the sidebar.
Tab arrangement: Drag tabs to rearrange them. You can have multiple tab groups. Create one by dragging a tab icon above or below an existing group.
Closing tab groups: Close all tabs in a group or drag them to move them. If only the tab area is highlighted, the dragged tab will merge with this group.

## Status bar
  
The status bar displays useful information, such as details on the current file, the current vault or the current status, such as the time and date.
The status bar contains navigation points and the mobile ribbon menu.
Status points are added by both core plugins and community plugins. Some items are interactive, while others are purely informative.
For example, the Word Count plugin adds the word and character count, which is not clickable. The Sync plugin adds an icon that both displays the synchronisation status and opens the sync log when clicked.
The desktop version of the status bar shows information on existing backlinks, the current editor view and the current word and character count of the Word Count plugin.

# Linking
More information on [https://help.obsidian.md/Home](https://help.obsidian.md/Home) under *Linking Notes and Files*

**Create links**

Create two notes and link them by using the double bracket syntax [[]]:

1. create a note with a topic-related name.
    
2. create another note and use the double bracket syntax to link to the first note.
    

**Links to non-existent notes**

Create links to notes that do not yet exist:

1. in a note, select a relevant text, e.g., "Basics of a particular topic".
    
2. use the double bracket syntax to create a link. Click on the link to create the new note.
    

**Effective navigation between notes**

Navigate not only by clicking directly on links, but also use backlinks and visual representations:

1. open a note and click on a backlink in the backlinks area to go to a linked note.
    
2. use visual representations such as the "Local Graph" on the desktop or mobile device to navigate effortlessly between different notes.
 
# Use and arrangement of multiple windows

You can have several windows open at the same time in Obsidian and arrange them in almost any order. To do this, hold down the tab key. Now you can drag individual windows around and arrange them. Within a window, another window can always be placed either above, below, to the left or to the right. This also works when nested, which means that any number of windows can be displayed at once.            

# Settings

Obsidian's behaviour and display can be extensively adjusted using the Obsidian settings.

## Editor

The behaviour of the editor can be adjusted in this section of the settings. This includes automatic Markdown completion, various editing modes and default values.

## Files & Links

Here you can set how Obsidian handles your files. The default storage location and the setting for what should happen to deleted files are particularly relevant here.

## Appearance

By default, you can choose between two basic themes, light and dark. However, there are also various themes that have been created by the community.
The theme can be changed in the settings in the "Appearance" section.

In addition, things such as fonts and some advanced display options can be customised in this section.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts can be created or customised here. Obsidian offers an enormous number of possible keyboard shortcuts that can make work much more efficient.

## Extensions

A large number of Obsidian's own or community extensions are available here. For these extensions, there are often separate settings for the respective extension.

# Local and global graph

The Graph View is very useful for visualising relationships efficiently and easily. The global graph view shows all notes that are available, while the local graph view is limited to the notes that are actually linked to the currently selected note.

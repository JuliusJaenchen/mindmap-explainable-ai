### search for 'tags'

If you want to search for tags in the nodes, you can also do so in the search bar. To do this, the keyword 'tag' is written at the beginning and Obsidian will suggest the existing tags.

### search for file paths

It is possible to search for paths. This search shows nodes according to their branches. This function is useful when the node structure is maintained with directories and folders. With the unidirectory-tagging-system, the search is not really helpful.

Furthermore, the search has a "History" function. The last searched keywords are suggested again.

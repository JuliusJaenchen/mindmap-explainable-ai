# Marco Polo Plugin:

Description:

A plugin for Obsidian. This plugin is responsible for searching in the nodes.

# Get Plugin as build

#### make build

Extract the archive or copy the resulting folder into the .obsidian/plugins/ folder. Don't forget to turn on community plugins and enable this one.

The search is guaranteed when the plugin is activated in Obsidian.

The plugin should already be in the library, in the repository. Before working with this, you should still check whether the plugin is activated.

# Activate plugin

To activate it, the user must open the preferences. In the preferences you open the plugin tab. The plugin “marco-polo” should be under the plugins. If the plugin is not already there, you can browse and install the plugins in the plugin browser.

Once the plugin is installed it should be activated if it is not already activated. There is a button here that says “activate”.

# Use plugin

Plugin will appear as an icon in the left vertical search bar. To use the plugin, the user must click this icon. Next, a search bar will appear in the middle of the screen. The keywords you are looking for can be entered into this search bar. The search then suggests nodes in which the keywords are present. The order of the suggestions is sorted. The sorting is calculated based on the frequency of the keyword in a node.

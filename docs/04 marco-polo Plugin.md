# [Marco Polo Plugin](https://github.com/roriwa/marco-polo#readme)

A plugin for Obsidian. This plugin offers a customised search-modal.

![example usage](https://github.com/roriwa/marco-polo/raw/main/README.assets/example-recording.gif)

> Note: This plugin is in an early phase and is missing some important features like searching for tags.
> That's why it's not included in this repository per default.

## Get the Plugin

Download the latest Plugin-Build from the [Releases](https://github.com/roriwa/marco-polo/releases/tag/latest) of the [Repository](https://github.com/roriwa/marco-polo) ([direct download link](https://github.com/roriwa/marco-polo/releases/download/latest/marco-polo.tgz))

Extract the downloaded archive into the `.obsidian/plugins/` folder of your obsidian-vault.
Don't forget to go into the settings of your vault and turn on `community plugins` and enable `Marco-Polo`.
(You may need to change the keyboard-binding as it conflicts with the core-plugin `Search`)

<!--
// Dunno why this was added and what use it has. Commented for now

# Activate plugin

To activate it, the user must open the preferences. In the preferences you open the plugin tab. The plugin “marco-polo” should be under the plugins. If the plugin is not already there, you can browse and install the plugins in the plugin browser.

Once the plugin is installed it should be activated if it is not already activated. There is a button here that says “activate”.

## Using the plugin

The Plugin will appear as an magnifying-glass-icon in the left vertical action-bar.
To use the plugin, the user must click this icon.
Next, a search modal will appear in the middle of the screen.
The keywords you are looking for can be entered into this search bar.
The search then suggests nodes in which the keywords are present.
The order of the suggestions is sorted.
The sorting is calculated based on the frequency of the keywords in a node.

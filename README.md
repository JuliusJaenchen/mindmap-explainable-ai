# mindmap-explainable-ai
This project focuses on visualizing the topic of explainable AI through Obsidian (markdown files). It is part of an university procect for the module "agile software development".
The customer wants to use a software to make the work for creating papers easier. The obsidian vault is going to be used to store quoting specific papers, also writing down definitions of important keywords for a specific topic.
This can be done using the node system from obsidian. Aditionally the Node system can be viewed using the visualizing feature of obsidian. Furthermore the zotero data can be imported into the obsidian vault using plugins. The requirements from the project are mostly covered with obsidian standard features. Further requirements, that arent already covered, will be implemented using Plugins. 
The final prototype that is chosen for the customer is the unidirectory-tagging-structure. 

## Roadmap
**Deadline Mo. 13.11.**: We want to build two prototypes of the XAI visualization in Obsidian, so that we have something to present in our workshop with the fictional customer.

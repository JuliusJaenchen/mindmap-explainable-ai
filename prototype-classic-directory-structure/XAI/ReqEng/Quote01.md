„1) What are the relevant target groups G, e.g., engineers, end users, or lawyers, and which traits characterize each group’s representatives R, e.g., specific background knowledge or cognitive capacities? 2) What are the explananda X, e.g., events or decisions? 3) Which aspects Y of the explananda X must be explained to which target group G, e.g., why is a decision justified, which causal chain of internal system events led up to it, why did some event e happen instead of event e′? 4) In which context C may an aspect Y need explanation, and what are the implied constraints? For example, explanations might have to be aural in a driving situation.“ (Köhl et al., 2019, p. 366)

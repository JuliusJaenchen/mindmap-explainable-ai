5 Step Method „1) Determine the relevant explainee roles within the ecosystem [2] 2) Determine the relevant explanation characteristics.  3) Capture explanation requirements from individuals related to the specific roles. This can be undertaken by a more traditional requirements engineering process, or applying agile methods for requirements elicitation.  4) Assess the ability of appropriate explainable methods to meet these requirements.  5) Map existing explainable techniques to XAI system requirements. This identifies which existing techniques address specific requirements, and highlight any gaps in capabilities to steer further research and development for the given application.“ (Hall et al., page 1-2)

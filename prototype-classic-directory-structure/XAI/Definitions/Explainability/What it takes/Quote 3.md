„We say that the why relates to the nature of an interpretation. In short, if the interpretation bares a causal meaning, then the why is being defined by the causal link. If the meaning is limited to a correlation, the why is left out of the scope of that particular interpretation.“ (Palacio et al., 2021, p. 3770)

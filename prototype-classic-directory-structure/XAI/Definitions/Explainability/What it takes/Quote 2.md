„Defining how something is being done can be addressed from two levels of abstraction. First, at the system-level, there is the question of how the model arrives at a prediction. Second, there is the issue of how the explanans is produced. In other words, what are the details behind the process that transforms between domains defined by the what, and used by the explanation.“ (Palacio et al., 2021, p. 3769)

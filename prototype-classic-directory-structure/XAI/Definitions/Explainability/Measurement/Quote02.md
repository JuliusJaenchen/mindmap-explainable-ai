„Furthermore, as the same explanation generally triggers different cognitive processes within people with different background and motivation [41], [42], it seems necessary to gain deeper insights into the representatives’ processing of explanations. For instance, one could use the think-aloud technique [43] trying to understand how people perceive a given explanation. After processing the explanation, the representatives could try to use self-explanation [44] to answer their own questions based on the explanation. This would show whether the explanation helped them to understand the issue. The representatives could then also be asked to try to transfer their new knowledge to a related issue [44]. This would help to evaluate whether the explanation not only helps them to understand a specific issue, but also enables people to transfer their new knowledge to new situations.“ (Köhl et al., 2019, p. 367)

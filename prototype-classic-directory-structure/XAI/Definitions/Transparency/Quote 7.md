#SubTransparency
„Futia et al. [10] and Lipton [5] classify three levels of transparency. Transparency considered at the level of the entire model is called simulatability, at the level of individual components such as parameters, called decomposability and at the level of the training algorithm, called algorithmic transparency.“ (Bellucci et al., 2021, p. 244)„ --> Maybe interesting for checking the transparency of a model in Questionnaires

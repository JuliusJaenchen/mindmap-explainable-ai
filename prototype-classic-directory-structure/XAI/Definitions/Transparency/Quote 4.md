#SubTransparency
„a system is transparent if it provides all the information about its design and functioning for scrutiny. Transparency does not guarantee that a user will be able to understand the system, but that it will have access to all the information concerning the training data, how the data was preprocessed, the performances of the system and so on. Transparency of a system is a notion similar to open-source programs, in which the whole code can be seen and studied by anyone, which prevents the designer to use this program for malicious purposes. Providing this information is likely to increase the trust in a system, as any experienced user can verify that the system is properly designed and does not present any flaw or bias that could alter the predictions and possibly discriminate.“ (Bellucci et al., 2021, p. 248)

#SubTransparency
„Meaningfulness is defined as how the stakeholders understand the information and what are the actions and reasons behind it. It encompasses data transparency, which answers what information is needed and who are the stakeholders; process transparency answers how something is performed; and policy transparency answers why an action is performed in the context of transparency.“ (Chazette et al., 2019, p. 224)

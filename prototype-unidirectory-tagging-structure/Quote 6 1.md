„Existing approaches aim at making given and usually noninterpretable systems explainable [14], [15]. System engineers attempt to generate explanations via feature importance [16] or explanation vectors [17]. Regarding document classification, Martens and Provost [18] propose linguistic explanations with bag-of-words features to make system recommendations more assessable for domain, e.g., legal or personnel, experts. To increase the transparency with respect to end users, comprehensible local approximations [19], counterfactuals [7], and contrastive explanations [20] come into play.“ (Köhl et al., 2019, p. 364)

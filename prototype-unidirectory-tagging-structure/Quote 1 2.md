„The notion we propose in the following is both target-aware and context-aware. What counts as an explanation of what for whom depends on the intended target group G, i.e., a certain kind of stakeholder, and the explanatory context C. Following insights of Achinstein [34] and Van Fraassen [35], we propose a pragmatic notion of “explanation for” in terms of understanding: Definition 1 (Explanation For): E is an explanation of explanandum X with respect to aspect Y for target group G, in context C, if and only if the processing of E in context C by any representative1 R of G makes R understand X with respect to Y .“ ([Köhl et al., 2019, p. 365])

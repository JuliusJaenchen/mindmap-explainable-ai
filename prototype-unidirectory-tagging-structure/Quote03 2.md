„AI innovations in education require a balance between learning theory, data science and design (Gas ˇevi ́c, Kovanovi ́c, & Joksimovi ́c, 2017). We need to consider what is possible with current XAI methods to be used throughout the design process. At the same time, there is value in identifying the educational stakeholders of the sociotechnical system from early stagesin the designprocess. Only then, wouldit be possibleto give an activevoice to learners,educators and other potentialend-users, and identify what to explain and how to explain it.“ (Khosravi et al., 2022, p. 8)

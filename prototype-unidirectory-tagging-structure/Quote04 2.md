„The concept of data storytelling was adopted to use narrative to communicate insights extracted from the multimodal data. The idea of data storytelling has been suggested, both by the general XAI research community (El-Assady et al., 2019) and the emerging XAI sub-community within learning analytics (De Laet et al., 2018), as a way to automatically structure explanations from data analysis and to emphasise some data points that are relevant to particular stakeholders or users.“ (Khosravi et al., 2022, p. 15)

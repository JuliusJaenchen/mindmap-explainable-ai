„We can conclude that interpretability refers to the ability of an object to be understood and studied by a user, with a reasonable cognitive effort. We use the term object rather than model, because as Lipton [5] mentioned, the input must be understandable as well as the model. Therefore, we could also define an input as interpretable. Interpretability also encompasses different notions such as decomposability and simulatability.“ (Bellucci et al., 2021, p. 243)

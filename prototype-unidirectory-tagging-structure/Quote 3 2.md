„The mere theoretical existence of some explanation is, however, not sufficient for a system to be explainable. We leverage the above characterization of explanation in order to specify what it takes for a system to be considered explainable: Definition 2 (Explainable System): A system S is explainable by means M with respect to aspect Y of an explanandum2 X, for target group G in context C, if and only if M is able to produce an E in context C such that E is an explanation of X with respect to Y , for G in C.“ (Köhl et al., 2019, p. 366)

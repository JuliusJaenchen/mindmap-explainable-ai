Levels of Transparency   1) Simulatability „In the strictest sense, a model might be called transparent if a person can contemplate the entire model at once.“ [Lipton, 2018, page 12-13] 2) Decomposability „A second notion of transparency might be that each part of the model—input, parameter, and calculation—admits an intuitive explanation.“ [Lipton, 2018, p. 14] 3) Algorithmic transparency „A final notion of transparency might apply at the level of the learning algorithm itself.“ [Lipton, 2018, p. 14]
